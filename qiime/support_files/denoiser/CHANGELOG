Change log
------------

== Qiime1.3 ===
Denoiser was integrated into the qiime 1.3 release and wil not be published stand-alone anymore.

== 0.9 ==
- Add titanium error profile and titanium switch to change thresholds and use new error profile.
- Combine individual sample results after denoising samples separately
- add switch -m/--max_num_rounds to abort phase II early. 
- add worst-case estimate of remaining rounds to log output.
- Fixed bug that left process hanging in rare cases.

== 0.851 ==
Fixed bug in denoise_postprocess for compatibility with Qiime.

== 0.85 ==
Replace file based client-server communication with sockets. Translates into much shorter execution time for most cluster environments.
Add -S option to denoiser.py: Split input into libraries and denoise on each lib separately.

== 0.84 ==
Fixed an issue with how centroids for a cluster are chosen. Output fasta file now sorted by length, which allows e.g. uclust to choose better centroids with the --user_sort option. This version is consistent with the latest QIIME svn version.


== 0.83 ==
Make scripts compatible with QIIME workflow scripts (pick_otus_through_otu_table.py). Compatible with the QIIME 1.0 release.


== 0.81 ==
Added new script make_cluster_jobs.py for submitting to qsub based clusters running PBS.


== 0.8==
Initial pre-release version
