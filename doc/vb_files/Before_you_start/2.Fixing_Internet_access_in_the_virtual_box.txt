If your virtual machine does not have Internet, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal and paste the following command: 

  sudo lshw -c network

- This should show you the network card(s) available to your virtual machine. Look for their "logical name" and write them down.

- Enter the following command to open a file for editing:

   sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces

- For each network card available, add entries to this file that looks like: 

   auto logical_name
   iface logical_name inet dhcp

- Finally, run this command: 

   sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

You may need to restart the virtual machine again. You will only need to do this once.
