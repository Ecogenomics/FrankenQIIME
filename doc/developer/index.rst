QIIME Developer Notes
=====================

QIIME is an open-source project, developed primarily in the Knight Lab at the University of Colorado at Boulder. If you're interested in getting involved, some experience programming in Python is useful, but not necessary. Please get in touch via qiime.help@colorado.edu. It's useful if you can attach some code that you're proud of as a code sample. New developer's code goes through a peer-review process before being committed to QIIME.
