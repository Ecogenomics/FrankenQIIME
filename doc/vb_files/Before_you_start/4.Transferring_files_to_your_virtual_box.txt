To analyze your data you will need to have your files inside this virtual machine. A few of your options for this are:

1. E-mail the data to yourself, if size permits, and check your email using Firefox within the virtual box.


2. Create a shared folder between your real machine (the host) and the virtual machine (the guest). Follow these steps:
 - At the bottom of the Virtual Machine screen there are some icons. 
   On Mac OS X: Click once on the blue/grey folder.
   On Windows: Right-click on the blue/grey folder.
 - Select "Shared Folders..."
 - A new window will open. Select the blue/grey folder icon with a green plus sign on the right of the new screen.
 - A new window will open. On the "Folder Path" option select the down arrow and click on the "Other..." option
 - A new window will open. Select the folder that you want to share with your virtual machine. Click OK 
 - Change the "Folder Name" option to Shared_Folder, select the "Make Permanent" option and make sure that the "Read-only" option is not selected. Click OK.
 - Click OK. 
 - Open a terminal on your virtual machine and run this command: sudo mount -a

If you do this everytime you restart your machine you will have the connection to your real machine through the Shared_Folder on your virtual machine Desktop.


3. Post the data on an external server, and get it using wget, scp, or sftp.
